### **What is a 2D Array?**
- A **2D array** is essentially an array of arrays. It can be visualized as a **grid** or a **table** with rows and columns.
- Example of a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns:
  ```
  [ [1, 2, 3, 4], 
    [5, 6, 7, 8], 
    [9, 10, 11, 12] ]
  ```
  Here:
  - Rows: 3 (indices 0 to 2)
  - Columns: 4 (indices 0 to 3)

### **Memory Representation**
- Internally, a 2D array is stored in **row-major order** (default in most languages, including Node.js). This means the rows are stored one after another in memory.
- The element at position `(i, j)` can be accessed by `array[i][j]`.

### **Creating a 2D Array in Node.js**
In JavaScript/Node.js, 2D arrays are created as nested arrays:
```javascript
// Create a 2D array
let arr = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];

// Accessing elements
console.log(arr[0][1]); // 2
console.log(arr[2][2]); // 9
```

### **Traversal Techniques**
1. **Row-wise Traversal**:
   Loop through each row, then loop through each column within the row.
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
       for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
           console.log(arr[i][j]);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Column-wise Traversal**:
   If all rows are of equal length, traverse column by column.
   ```javascript
   for (let j = 0; j < arr[0].length; j++) {
       for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
           console.log(arr[i][j]);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Diagonal Traversal**:
   For elements on the main diagonal, indices `(i, i)`:
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(arr.length, arr[0].length); i++) {
       console.log(arr[i][i]);
   }
   ```

### **Common Tricks and Patterns**
1. **Bounds Checking**:
   Always ensure you don’t access indices out of bounds:
   ```javascript
   if (i >= 0 && i < arr.length && j >= 0 && j < arr[i].length) {
       console.log(arr[i][j]);
   }
   ```

2. **Flattening a 2D Array**:
   If you need a 1D array from a 2D array:
   ```javascript
   let flattened = arr.flat();
   console.log(flattened); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
   ```

3. **Using `map()`**:
   Apply operations to all elements:
   ```javascript
   let doubled = arr.map(row => row.map(val => val * 2));
   console.log(doubled); // [ [2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12], [14, 16, 18] ]
   ```

### **Practice Problems**
Let’s start with **easy-level problems**. Here are a few to get you started:

1. **Sum of all elements**:
   Write a function to calculate the sum of all elements in a 2D array.

2. **Transpose of a Matrix**:
   Convert the rows of the matrix into columns.

3. **Row-wise Maximum**:
   Find the largest number in each row of a 2D array.
